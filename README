TenSixty is a communication protocol targeted at arduio-linux serial connections.

It provids resilient, two-way communication over an unreliable connection,
ensuring the following:
- guaranteed packet delivery
- in-order packet delivery

|----------|       |----------|

The protocol is loosely based on TCP, and involves sending packets between two
devices. The layout of a packet mostly defines the protocol. There are a few
concepts to note:

1) Packets consist of a header and a data block.
2) Each packet containing data has a transmission index, used to ensure ordered
    delivery and no skipped packets. Indices range from 1-127; 0 is reserved to
    mean "no data." The 128th packet will loop around and start again at 1.
3) There is a limit on how many packets may be live at once, which is why the
    indexing in #2 works -- it's always clear from local context what the next
    indices are. This limit isn't fixed, but will typically be < 10, since
    microcontrollers have limited memory to hold pending packets.
4) If there's an error, and the reader got a valid header, the receiving device
    will send back an error ack, which triggers a resend.
5) A writer will also retry sending a packet if it gets a skipped ack. In other
    words, N and N+2 are acked before N+1 means retransmit N+1.
6) Finally, the writer will retry sending a packet if enough time has elapsed
    without an ack. This handles lost headers in the absence of subsequent
    packets.

A packet consists of, in order:

Header
  - Two "start sequence" bytes, 10, followed by 60 (decimal). Hence the protocol
    name. This simplifies implementations.
  - One "ack" byte, consisting of a MSB, which indicates "error" if high and
    "ok" if low. The remaining 7 bits encode a transmission index from 1 to 127.
    If the index is zero, that means nothing is acked. Throughout
  - One byte for the index currently being sent, or 0 for no data.
  - One byte for the length of the data segment, meaning the data can be up to
    256 bytes long.
  - Two checksum bytes to verify integrity of the header. These are a fletcher
    checksum of the previous five bytes.
Data
  - A length of N (up to 256) bytes being delivered.
  - Two checksum bytes on the previous N data bytes (not header) to verify
    integrity of the data block.
